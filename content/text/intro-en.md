For over 10 years, I have been working with international cultural, artistic, and social institutions. I've started as a cinematographer and video editor, and later took on roles as a director and creative producer as well, which allows me to bring both technical and creative vision to every project.

I make long-form videos, such as documentaries and educational courses on art, culture, and popular science, as well as animated explainer videos, teaser campaigns and other short-form visuals. 

Each story needs its unique visual and sound language. That's why i often work together with various artists to create a distinctive look and feel that brings our shared visions to life.
